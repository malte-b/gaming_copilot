Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life.\nUpon completing the Getting StartedCharacter Creation and the initial dialogue with Robin at the Bus Stop, this is the location the player is transported to. Inherited from their grandpagrandfather after quitting their job at Setting#Joja CorporationJoja Corporation, it is their duty to restore the land and make use of it.\n:''See Getting Started for more information''\n\n==Farm Maps==\nmain articleFarm Maps\nWhen creating a new character players can select from a number of different maps for their farm. Each of these maps offer unique benefits, and favor specific skills.\n\nThe player's farm house will appear the same from the outside on all maps, but begins with a uniquely styled interior after the maps theme. These house interiors offer different furniture pieces, wallpaper and flooring for each map.\n\nEach map will change how the farm appears on the game map slightly. Most simply change how the farm area appears, but some change areas outside the farm on the map - the Forest farm extends the forest to the west toward the farm and the Riverland map connects to a river which flows south of the desert. These changes are only reflected on the world map; no changes are made to the actual game world outside the player's farm based on map selection.\n\nAfter selecting a map it cannot be changed; characters are permanently tied to their map type once created. Each map takes up the same area, but there are different amounts of usable, farmable, buildable land on each.\n class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name\n! Description\n!

By default, the house features a TV, a single bed, a picture, a table and chair, decorative dishes, and a fireplace. The farmhouse can be upgraded 3 times: once by paying Price10000 and giving 450 Wood to Robin, and again by paying Price65000 and giving 100 Hardwood to Robin. The final upgrade adds a cellar which can age wine and cheese in Casks; it costs Price100000.  All upgrades take approximately 2 full days to complete.\n\n===Marriage===\nmain articleMarriage\nUpon completion of the marriage ceremony, the person whom the player marries will have a portion of their room moved into the right side of their house. However, this requires at least a tier 2 farmhouse.\n\n==Shipping Box==\nmain articleShipping\nThe shipping box is a rectangular wooden box located to the right of the farmhouse. Items with value can be placed inside the box (excluding tools) and will be sold overnight with the total earnings from selling the items displayed once the player goes to bed for the night. The latest item placed in the box can be recovered, but items placed before the latest item may not be recovered. For example, if the player places 10 corn in, it may be recovered before shipping out for the night, however, if the player places an eggplant on top of the corn, only the eggplant may be recovered, but the corn reaches its inevitable fate of being sold.\n\n==Mailbox==\nmain articleLetters\nThe mailbox is located to the bottom-right corner of the farmhouse. It is used to receive and read incoming letters. Any unread mail will be indicated by the display of a floating speech bubble containing an envelope icon hovering over the mailbox.\n\n==Crops==\nFile:Scarecrow_Range.pngthumbrightVisual representation of the protection range of a scarecrow\nmain articleCrops\nSeeds for crops can be purchased from Pierre in his shop or the JojaMart with the selection correlated to the active season, or obtained from completing Community Center bundles or Museum rewards. However, these seeds can only be planted on the farm or in the Greenhouse. In order to begin the process of growing a crop, the player must find a clear 1x1 area to till with a hoe. Once tilled, the seed may be planted and watered. All crops must be watered daily in order to continue growing. Once a crop is fully grown, it may be harvested. Most crops grow once, and the entire plant is harvested, but for crops like berries and corn, these crops only have their edible portions harvested, allowing the crop to grow back faster than when it was planted. However, once the season for the crop ends, it will wither and die immediately.\n\n===Fruit Trees===\nmain articleFruit Trees\nFruit Tree seeds can be purchased from Pierre's Shop and occasionally from the Traveling Cart and sowed on the farm in the center of a 3x3 square. All fruit trees take approximately 28 days to mature completely, and, depending on the season, will produce 1 fruit per day. Fruit trees do not produce fruit during winter.\n\n===Crows===\nAnimals#CrowsCrows may randomly spawn on the farm each morning there are crops planted.  Crows destroy crops by eating them. To avoid this, players may craft Scarecrows and place them within range of growing crops.  Collectible Scarecrow#RarecrowsRarecrows can also be used to scare off crows.\n\n==Buildings==\nmain articleCarpenter's Shop\nBuildings can be purchased from Robin in the Carpenter's Shop at varying prices. Farm buildings are required to house animals. Both coops and barn buildings have upgrades, and the base building must be purchased before the upgrade. Each of these buildings can be built multiple times to support more animals.\n\nTip: It's a good idea to build a silo before purchasing animals to place in farm buildings, so there is a place to store hay for them to eat.\n\n==Debris==\nFarm debris is a naturally regenerating element on the Farm.  It includes rocks, twigs, and weeds.\n====Small Plants====\n class=\"wikitable\"\n-\n! Image !! Name !! Tool Required !! Drops !!

Completing the Bundles#PantryPantry section of the Community Center will cause the greenhouse to be restored, and be of use to the player. It features a 12x10 plot for crops, and a water trough to refill the Watering can. Any seeds from any season may be planted here, even during the winter, giving the player a large advantage. Buildings may not be placed in the greenhouse.\n\n===The Cave===\nFile:CaveMushrooms.pngright120pxthumbMushroom boxes\nmain articleThe Cave\nOnce total earnings reach Price25000, Demetrius meets the player at their door the next day. He states that he is working on research and asks if they wouldn't mind if he used their cave. He gives the player the option to either have fruit bats in the cave, or to install 6 mushroom boxes. Fruit bats will leave random fruit in the cave overnight, while the Mushroom Cave has a Dehydrator that dries out mushrooms, and mushroom boxes that will produce one of five different types of mushrooms on a regular basis.\n\n===Grandpa's Shrine===\nmain articleGrandpa\nQuoteWait for my return at the dawn of the 3rd year.\n\nGrandpa's Shrine is a landmark located in the northwestern corner of the farm. Upon encountering the shrine, a note is present that reads \"Wait for my return at the dawn of the 3rd year\". Upon reaching the dawn of the 3rd year, a manifestation of grandpa appears and evaluates the player's performance.\n\nAfter their third year of being on the farm and his initial evaluation, if the player got less than four candles, his shrine will still be active.\nQuote There's a diamond-shaped slot in the shrine... was that always there?\nIf the player places a Diamond into Grandpa's Shrine, he will reappear and re-evaluate the farm the next day. He will apologize for being too harsh and promptly give them a new answer if the player made some changes. Interacting with the shrine after this event will produce a Statue Of Perfection, if all four candles are lit.\n\nAfter achieving Perfection, a stone carving of a Stardrop will appear above the shrine.\n\n==Additional Information==\n:File:Brown Chicken.png26px ''See: Animals''\n:File:Cheese.png26px ''See: Artisan Goods''",

Particularly, I would like to update the image of the third page to contain new items, such as Mystic Syrup and Dried Fruit, together with their hyperlinks. Also, Jellies and PicklesPickles and Juice have new icons and Clam was removed. How can I do that?\n\nI'm pretty sure I know, or am able to learn, how to handle the technical side. All I need to know is what procedure I should follow - I can't edit the page directly because it is protected. Am I supposed to provide the code and the resources here for someone authorized to add them?\n\nCheers,\nUser:AdayahAdayah (User talk:Adayahtalk) 17:05, 6 April 2024 (UTC)\n:Hello Adayah! The template is protected so that editors know that template changes need to be carried out in all 12 languages. If you're willing to do that, that would be amazing!\n:Once you have figured out the new structure of the underlying table, it will be the same in all languages; the only difference between languages will be the specific terms used in links. And, those can be found by Modding:Editing XNB files#Unpack game filesunpacking the game files.\n:The first step would be confirming that the screens in all 12 languages looks the same. In past versions of the game, some items were in different places across languages, so we need to make sure that's not the case with v1.6. After that, we need new images for all languages (the sprites for Milk and Goat's Milk vary in Spanish, French, and Japanese, with Portuguese using the Spanish image). You can see all languages' variations here: :Category:Collections images. \n:Once the correct images are uploaded, then work can begin on the template. The structure is basically this: The images are the background of a table, and each table cell is a link to an item. Familiarity with html tables would be helpful.\n:So, do you think you'd like to take on all 12 languages? User:Margotbeanmargotbean (User talk:Margotbeantalk) 18:05, 6 April 2024 (UTC)\n\n::Hi. I'm also interested in helping editing this template. The missing item pages are already created, such as Smoked Fish and Mystic Syrup, this will be mostly a matter of reordering and adding the new items. Can we use these images already uploaded? I'm familiar with HTML and have edited templates in other wikis. Let me know if I can help.\n::User:MiKauMiKau (User talk:MiKautalk) 21:03, 13 April 2024 (UTC)",

Each and every 32-bit program has their own 4 GiB \"addressable memory space\", ''totally separate from each other'' (although, as before, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/memory-limits-for-windows-releases?redirectedfrom=MSDN#memory-and-address-space-limits only 2 GiB will be usable unless the program was compiled with a certain flag. As long as you have enough memory in your computer, and no misbehaving programs fully consume their memory space, then the game will be able to see -- and use -- nearly all its (2 GiB) memory space.\n\nUser:PepoluanPepoluan (User talk:Pepoluantalk) 14:15, 28 May 2021 (UTC)\n\n: We only care about 64-bit Windows here, since players on 32-bit Windows can't use this. Both <samp>Stardew Valley.exe</samp> and <samp>StardewModdingAPI.exe</samp> are marked <samp>LARGEADDRESSAWARE</samp>, so in theory they should have access to a full 4GB of memory space. It'd be great to provide a more accurate explanation on the page, but do you know why players often report <samp>OutOfMemoryException</samp> errors with 1–3GB memory used despite having plenty of available system memory? For example, here's https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/issues/749 an <samp>OutOfMemoryException</samp> crash on a system with 32GB of memory with 1.2GB in use by the game. —<small>User:PathoschildPathoschild (User talk:Pathoschildtalk) 15:26, 29 May 2021 (UTC)</small>\n\n:: I would say that it isn't true in _any_ situation.\n\n::* On 32-bit Windows, it isn't true as far as I have ever been aware. <code>increaseuserva</code> specifies that you want processes to have 3 GiB of virtual address space available instead of the default 2 GiB. The default was specified as many much older programs assumed that logical addresses wouldn't be larger than that and would fail.\n::* Process logical address space ''is not shared between processes''. ''Physical'' memory is, but that is mapped to processes (into their logical address space). Even 32-bit NT can address more than 4 GiB of physical RAM via PAE. If you have two 32-bit processes, they do not share a 2 GiB logical address space. Or a 3 GiB logical address space. They have their own logical address spaces. They compete for ''physical'' memory, but that's true of any system.\n::* On 64-bit Windows, obviously the same applies. Except that if a process is flagged as <code>LARGEADDRESSAWARE</code>, it gets access to the full 4 GiB address space instead of 3, as the kernel does not need to be mapped within the 4 GiB address space (during an interrupt, the processor switches back to long mode and the kernel can access its own memory which is mapped outside of what the process is aware of).\n\n:: I mean, unless we're talking about Windows 9x. Those could and would operate weirdly... but Windows NT has ''never'' operated this way.\n\n:: The reason players still see <samp>OutOfMemoryException</samp> is that the process is exhausting its logical address space. Simple as that. You can exhaust it without ever committing physical pages.\n\n:: User:AmeisenAmeisen (User talk:Ameisentalk) 23:22, 10 October 2021 (UTC)\n\n::: I rewrote that part to be vague instead: \"''That means your game ran out of available memory mid-session, which can happen even if your computer has plenty of physical memory available due to 32-bit limitations.''\" It'll be a moot point soon, since all modded players will have 64-bit in Stardew Valley 1.5.5. —<small>User:PathoschildPathoschild (User talk:Pathoschildtalk) 23:32, 10 October 2021 (UTC)</small>",

Each level of Luck#Luck BuffsLuck Buff increases the chance by 5%.<ref name=\"mineshaft\"/> So with +5 Luck, 30% of non-Lava Eel catches will be Cave Jelly.\n\nUnlike other locations, fishing on Floor 100 of the Mines does not use a predetermined value to determine whether the farmer successfully catches a Jelly.<ref name=\"mineshaft\"/>\n\n==References==\n<references>\n    <ref name=\"mineshaft\">See <samp>MineShaft::getFish</samp> in the game code.</ref>\n</references>",

It can only be harvested from Grass if there is an unfilled Silo on the farm. For grass, when using a Scythe, there is a 50% chance of producing 1 Hay each time a tile is completely cleared of Grass; using a Golden Scythe, the chance is 75% and using an Iridium Scythe the chance is 100%; using any scythe on wheat, grants a 40% chance for hay. If successfully cut, a Grass#Blue GrassBlue Grass will produce two pieces of hay, instead of the usual one. Note that although Grass can also be cleared using any WeaponsWeapon or Crafting#BombsBomb, no Hay is produced in these cases. All Hay harvested from Grass is immediately placed directly into the farm's Silos. When harvesting Wheat using any scythe there is a 40% chance that each harvested Wheat will drop one unit of Hay, which in this case added to the player's inventory (or the Junimo Hut storage, if harvested by Junimos). Hay from Wheat does not go directly into Silos.\n\nHay may also be obtained by cutting weeds with a weapon with the Forge#EnchantmentsHaymaker enchantment, which gives a 1/3 chance for each cut weed to produce a Hay. Hay obtained this way goes directly into Silos if cut on the farm, and into the player's inventory if outside of the farm.\n\nEach Silo can store up to 240 pieces of Hay. Hay stored in Silos can only be withdrawn using the Hay HopperHoppers found in Coops and Barns. When right-clicked, a Hopper will dispense Hay equal to the number of animals living in the building &mdash; but no more than the number of empty slots in the building's Feeding Bench. Therefore, it becomes impossible to withdraw Hay from a Hopper in deluxe Coops and Barns where the autofeeder always keeps the feeding bench full (see #TipTip). Right-clicking on a Hopper if Hay is the active item in the player's inventory will transfer the entire stack of Hay into the Silos. Once retrieved from the hopper, hay can be transferred to chests for storage from the inventory, bypassing the need for multiple silos.\n\nHay can be purchased, either from Marnie's Ranch for Price50 or from the Desert Trader who sells 3 Hay in exchange for 1 Omni Geode on Mondays. Marnie may randomly send the player 30 Hay in the mail. Marnie also sells Hay at her Desert Festival Desert Festival#Villager Shopsshop for Price1Calico Calico Egg. 100 Hay is sometimes sold at the Stardew Valley Fair for Price500Token. Fifteen pieces of hay are provided by Mayor Lewis at the start of the game if the player has chosen the Farm Maps#Map TypesMeadowlands Farm.\n\n==Feeding Animals==\nFile:Chickens fed.pngthumbThe interior of a basic Coop showing the locations of the Hay HopperHopper and feeding bench.\nAll Coop-dwelling and Barn-dwelling Animals eat 1 Hay per day as Animals#Foodfood whenever there is no fresh Grass available. This Hay must manually be placed on the feeding bench in the animal's home building; the Hay HopperHopper in the building facilitates withdrawing Hay from the Silos to place on the bench, although the Hay can come from any source. The autofeeder in Deluxe Barns and Coops automatically fills the feeding bench. If unfed, animals will not die, but they will be Animals#Moodunhappy.\n\nGiven that animals cannot go outside during Winter, it is advisable to Harvest as much Hay as possible by Fall 28 in preparation for the winter. Building multiple Silos may be necessary to provide sufficient storage capacity for Winter. Alternatively, Hay can be withdrawn via a Hopper and placed into Chests. If the farm runs out of stored Hay during the winter, the only ways to feed animals are by purchasing Hay, scything any grass that may be left over from Fall, or by growing Wheat in the Greenhouse or the Ginger Island#The FarmGinger Island Farm. \n\n==Gifting==\nGiftsByItem\nhate=Robin,Demetrius,Maru,Sebastian,Linus,Pierre,Caroline,Abigail,Alex,George,Evelyn,Lewis,Clint,Penny,Pam,Emily,Haley,Jas,Vincent,Jodi,Kent,Sam,Leah,Shane,Marnie,Elliott,Gus,Dwarf,Wizard,Harvey,Sandy,Willy,Krobus,Leo\n\n\n==Quests==\nHay is not used in any quests.\n\n==Bundles==\n10 Hay are used in the Bundlefoddery.\n\n==Tailoring==\nHay is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create a TailoringGrass Skirt.

    "page_content": ". Holding down the left mouse button, the space bar, or keyx will make the cart jump higher.  Pressing keyp will pause the game. Along the way, gaps, railway ends, and other level-specific obstacles will be encountered, which must be avoided by jumping. Not jumping at the right time or falling through a gap will result in losing a life. There are two modes in the game: Progress Mode and Endless Mode.\n\n==Progress Mode==\nIn Progress Mode, the player starts with 3 extra lives. When all lives are lost, the run will end. After completing a stage, lives will be replenished up to a minimum of 3. Collecting 100 coins will also grant an extra life. Each level also has three pieces of fruit: Cherries, Orange, and Grapes. Each is worth 10 coins, and completing a level after having collected all three pieces of fruit grants another extra life (if the player finishes the level with fewer than 3 lives, this extra life is granted ''after'' their lives are replenished to 3). After finishing 6 levels, the game ends.\n\n==Endless Mode==\nIn Endless Mode, the player only has one life; dying will end the run. A numerical score is tracked along the run, with points gained by moving through and completing levels. Every tile of distance the player travels adds 10 points. Each coin collected gives 40 points, and collecting one of the three fruits gives 1000 points. Finishing a level gives 5000 points, and a bonus 5000 points at the end of a level for collecting all three fruits. All 8 levels are played in order in this mode (all except \"???\"). In the event that the player finishes the last level in this mode, it will repeat from the first level. \n\nEndless Mode is used in Mr. Qi's Quests#Let's Play A Game\"Let's Play A Game\" Special Order. The player must score 50,000 points within a 7 day period. The reward is 20 Qi Gems.\n\n==Levels==\nSome levels reuse existing background music, while others have songs composed specifically for them.\n\n===Crumble Cavern===\n''(Music: Mines (Crystal Bells), Mines (A Flicker In The Deep), or Mines (Star Lumpy) at random)''\n\nThe first level is relatively straightforward; there's the occasional falling boulder to worry about, but otherwise, just focus on jumping and grabbing coins/fruit. Make sure to land on top of an obstacle if it cannot be avoided, because that would result in destroying it. Crumble Cavern is also the first level in Endless Mode.\n\n===Slippery Slopes===\n''(Music: Mines (Icicles), Mines (Marimba Of Frozen Bones), or Mines (Cloth) at random)''\n\nThe second level is fairly well-previewed by its title screen: downward slopes are slippery, and there are a lot of independent upward slopes that will need to be jumped in between. Sliding down slopes gives extra speed, which translates into longer jumps, and can take some getting used to. Finishing this level in under 60 seconds will result in skipping The Gem Sea Giant and Slomp's Stomp, and going straight to Ghastly Galleon. Slippery Slopes is the second level in Endless Mode.\n\n===???===\n''(Music: No music, just wind ambience)''\n\nThis alternate second level has an empty preview screen with a title \"???\". The path to this level is indicated by dots on the level map, and occurs at the wooden bridge between the rocky and ice areas. To reach this stage, clear \"Crumble Cavern\" without losing any lives and collecting all coins and fruit. The scenery is that of a dark cave covered in stalagmites and stalactites with a water floor. With no unique obstacles or boulders, clearing this level should be no extra challenge. This level does however contain a huge amount of coins, so try to collect as many extra lives as possible.\n\n===The Gem Sea Giant===\n''(Music: Junimo Kart (The Gem Sea Giant))''\n\nThe third level takes place underwater, resulting in slower falls. In addition, there's a large whale on the right side of the screen that periodically spews bubbles, which (like all hazards) are fatal upon impact unless the player lands on top of them, which causes the player to bounce a fair distance into the air. Collecting coins/fruit may be difficult, if not impossible, without jumping off the top of bubbles to reach high-up rails. The Gem Sea Giant is also the third level in Endless Mode.\n\n===Slomp's Stomp===\n''(Music: Junimo Kart (Slomp's Stomp))''\n\nThis alternate third level is chosen at random. It's somewhat of an inversion of Slippery Slopes, as each upward slope is sticky and slows the player down. Slowing down is bad, as a giant bouncing slime persistently chases the player from behind throughout the level, leaping along tracks and pits. Upon contact, it will deplete one of the player's lives if they slow down too much. Slomp's Stomp is the fifth level in Endless Mode.\n\n===Ghastly Galleon===\n''(Music: Junimo Kart (Ghastly Galleon))''\n\nOn the fourth level, the player moves faster, meaning jumps cover a larger distance and the player has less time to react to what's going on. This level has large gaps that need to be jumped over and some narrow platforms to land on. Additionally, there are ghosts that move in circular patterns and are fatal on contact, even when landed on. Upon completing the level in Progress Mode, Glowshroom Grotto and Red Hot Rollercoaster each have a 50% chance to be chosen as the next level. Ghastly Galleon is the fourth level in Endless Mode.\n\n===Glowshroom Grotto===\n''(Music: Junimo Kart (Glowshroom Grotto))''\n\nThis level has pairs of giant purple mushrooms; riding on one causes it to lower and the other to raise upwards. How long the player spends on the mushrooms must be timed precisely to successfully reach the next rail. There are occasional smaller red mushrooms placed onto the rails that shoot slow-moving spore cloud projectiles upwards; carefully jump through a gap in the pattern to avoid dying. There are also smaller purple mushrooms that can be bounced off of, similar to boulders and bubbles. Glowshroom Grotto is the sixth level in Endless Mode.\n\n===Red Hot Rollercoaster===\n''(Music: Mines (Danger!))''\n\nThis alternate fifth level has, as the title screen suggests, lots of adjacent diagonal ramps, leading to potential confusion on where the player should jump from. There are also randomly generated falling boulders, like Crumble Cavern. It also has a tendency towards stretches of mostly empty space scattered with short sections of rail, requiring constant jumping to safely make it across. Red Hot Rollercoaster is the seventh level in Endless Mode.\n\n===Sunset Speedway===\n''(No music, just nighttime sound effects)''\n\nThe final level is full of short rails at widely scattered heights, making it very easy to slip off. Sunset Speedway is the eighth level in Endless Mode before transitioning back to Crumble Caverns upon completion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"165px\">\nJunimo Kart Modes.pngModes\n1 map.pngMap screen at the start of the game\n2 crumbleCavern.pngCrumble Cavern title screen\n3 crumbleCavernLevel.pngCrumble Cavern\n3.5 secret.png???

From the viewpoint of someone who isn't used to modding, a lot of things that are obvious to experienced modders aren't obvious to me. In this case, having the actual location and filename of the log file absent from the Logging page really stuck out.\n\nAlso, having an example output of the log really helps give an idea of what the log file \"looks like\" and can help confirm that modders are looking at the correct file.\n\nI'd like to add both of this information back to the Logging page. —User:AlSweigartAlSweigart (User talk:AlSweigarttalk) 11:29, 25 February 2022 (UTC)\n\n: Hi! The log location is documented at https://smapi.io/log/ smapi.io/log, which is linked from the FAQs section I just added. Both the location and format can change over time (e.g. as the game is released to new platforms), so it's better not to duplicate them on the logging API page. The new FAQs section suggests uploading your current log file to see a sample. —<small>User:PathoschildPathoschild (User talk:Pathoschildtalk) 16:45, 25 February 2022 (UTC)</small>",

Yes, the template can and should be translated into Spanish on the Spanish wiki.  If you want to do the translations, that would be fantastic!

You deleted the Chinese discussion page earlier and said, \"template is being deprecated.\" This template is very useful, and I think it's a pity to abandon it. So can you lift my permission to edit templates? \nAs you mentioned earlier, my previous editing of other templates resulted in the blue link not matching the image position very well. I will try my best to make them fit better this time. I will update the old images used in this template, and then upload the English version of this template first. If you think there are any issues or no issues with the version I uploaded, please reply to me. If there are no issues, I will translate based on this template and upload the remaining 11 language versions.User:第二个熺第二个熺 (User talk:第二个熺talk) 05:38, 5 May 2024 (UTC)\n:No, the template is being deprecated.

This exact location is revealed in ''Lost Books#Secrets of the Legendary FishSecrets of the Legendary Fish''.\n* The bobber must be located in water with a Fishing#Fishing ZoneFishing Zone of at least 3, ''i.e.,'' it must be at least four tiles away from any land in every direction.\n** The Glacierfish can appear one tile closer to land (Zone=2) if the bobber lands in Fishing#BubblesBubbles.\n\nWhen all of these requirements are met, each cast has a 50% chance of hooking a Glacierfish. Unlike with other Legendary Fish, using a Curiosity Lure does not increase the chance of hooking it.\n\nAlthough the Glacierfish cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Glacierfish (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it or by PansPanning in the correct #Maptiles with the Forge#EnchantmentsFisher enchantment. \n\nThe Glacierfish can be caught regardless of season using Magic Bait.\n\n==Map==\nThe Glacierfish can be found off the southern tip of Arrowhead Island in Cindersap Forest.\nMap105177\n\nFile:GlacierfishLocations.png400px\nclear\n\n==Gifting==\nGiftsByItem\ndislike=Robin,Maru,Caroline,Abigail,Alex,George,Lewis,Clint,Penny,Emily,Jas,Vincent,Jodi,Kent,Sam,Leah,Shane,Marnie,Gus,Dwarf,Wizard,Harvey,Sandy,Krobus\nneutral=Demetrius,Sebastian,Linus,Pam,Elliott,Willy,Leo\nhate=Pierre,Evelyn,Haley\n\n\n==Bundles==\nThe Glacierfish is not used in any bundles.\n\n==Recipes==\nRecipesheaderhide=buff,duration\n:Maki RollRecipeRow/NoBuffs\n:Quality FertilizerRecipeRow/NoBuffs\n:SashimiRecipeRow/NoBuffs\nRecipesfooter\n\n==Dyeing==\nGlacierfish can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.\n\n==Fish Pond==\nGlacierfish can be placed in a Fish Pond.
